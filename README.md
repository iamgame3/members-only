This app is meant to test me on my ability to use user authentication within an Express app.

To run this app, go here: [Super Message Board](https://super-message-board.glitch.me/)

The home page shows all of the posts. To be able to post, sign up for an account. To see who uploaded what posts and when they uploaded it, become a member. To delete posts, become an admin.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
